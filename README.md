# Java playground
A repository for me to experiment with Java frameworks and Proof-of-Concepts. 

## 1. Hibernate (in hibernate folder)
Learning on how to use Hibernate. Implemented using 3 approaches (Reading annotation config file, reading, reading pojo config file and properties configuration)  Classes are implemented in 2 ways (ordinary POJO and with annotations). Class mapping file (for nomal POJO), configuration files (for POJO and annotation approaches) and a utility file are created. 

## 2. HelloWorld
Experiment with debugger

## 3. Multithreading 
Implementation of threads implementing runnable interface and extending Thread class. Multithreading allows task to be run in parallel. 

## 4. Exception handling
Handling a customised exception with a try-catch

## 5. Future
For handling asynchronous computations. Codes implement ForkJoinTask/ForkJoinPool, Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor() and Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int threadSize);
